1. BioLitMiner.py
This Python script  is designed to retrieve, process, and analyze biomedical literature from PubMed based on user-provided keywords. It uses the Biopython library to search PubMed, fetch article details, and parse Medline records. The script starts by defining lists of disease names, organisms, and sample types to later identify in abstracts. When the user inputs a query, it searches PubMed for matching articles and retrieves the corresponding records in batches. Each record is parsed to extract PubMed ID, publication year, authors, affiliations, and funding information. The affiliations are further processed to separate institute, state, country, and email addresses. The script flattens the author-affiliation pairs into a structured pandas DataFrame for easier analysis. It then scans the abstracts of each article to detect mentions of diseases, organisms, and sample types from the predefined lists, effectively annotating each record with biomedical context. Finally, the cleaned and annotated data is saved as a CSV file on the desktop, providing a comprehensive dataset of PubMed articles with detailed author, affiliation, funding, and biomedical annotation, which can be used for downstream analysis, research tracking, or literature surveys. It also handles errors during fetching to ensure continuity.
This script is essentially an automated PubMed literature extractor, annotator, and organizer.

2. BioContMiner.py
This Python script is a PubMed email extractor that automates the retrieval of article metadata from PubMed based on user-specified keywords. It first searches PubMed for articles matching the query, fetching up to 1000 results by default. The articles are retrieved in chunks to handle large datasets, and each record is parsed using Biopython’s Medline parser. For every article, the script extracts PubMed ID, publication year, country of publication, authors, and their email addresses. It carefully matches authors with their corresponding affiliation lines to find email addresses, defaulting to “No emails found” when none are present. The script then flattens this structured data into a pandas DataFrame so each row corresponds to an author with associated PubMed metadata. Finally, it allows the user to specify a filename and saves the resulting dataset as a CSV, providing an organized and easily accessible table of authors, emails, and article details. This is particularly useful for academic networking, outreach, or building contact lists from scientific publications.
Essentially, this script is an automated PubMed author-email harvesting and CSV exporting tool.
